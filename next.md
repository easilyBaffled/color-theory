Thoughts

- what if each item has a cost and color, so you have to spend any amount of cards to equal that cost additional color
  can change affects of things so green, red, blue shell all have different costs and effects
- make entity types boolean flags so body is 0001, item is 0010 shell is 010 green 1000 so green shell would be 1110
